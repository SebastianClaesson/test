"[Preview]: All Internet traffic should be routed via your deployed Azure Firewall";"Azure Security Center has identified that some of your subnets aren't protected with a next generation firewall. Protect your subnets from potential threats by restricting access to them with Azure Firewall or a supported next generation firewall";"https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/tree/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Network/ASC_All_Internet_traffic_should_be_routed_via_Azure_Firewall.json"

"Network interfaces should disable IP forwarding";"This policy denies the network interfaces which enabled IP forwarding. The setting of IP forwarding disables Azure's check of the source and destination for a network interface. This should be reviewed by the network security team.";"https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/tree/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Network/NetworkIPForwardingNic_Deny.json"
"Network interfaces should not have public IPs";"This policy denies the network interfaces which are configured with any public IP. Public IP addresses allow internet resources to communicate inbound to Azure resources, and Azure resources to communicate outbound to the internet. This should be reviewed by the network security team.";"https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/tree/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Network/NetworkPublicIPNic_Deny.json"
"Deploy a flow log resource with target network security group";"Configures flow log for specific network security group. It will allow to log information about IP traffic flowing through an network security group. Flow log helps to identify unknown or undesired traffic, verify network isolation and compliance with enterprise access rules, analyze network flows from compromised IPs and network interfaces.";"https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/tree/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Network/NetworkSecurityGroup_FlowLog_Deploy.json"
"Configure network security groups to enable traffic analytics";"Traffic analytics can be enabled for all network security groups hosted in a particular region with the settings provided during policy creation. If it already has Traffic analytics enabled, then policy does not overwrite its settings. Flow Logs are also enabled for the Network security groups that do not have it. Traffic analytics is a cloud-based solution that provides visibility into user and application activity in cloud networks.";"https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/tree/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Network/NetworkSecurityGroup_FlowLog_TrafficAnalytics_Deploy.json"

"Deploy network watcher when virtual networks are created";"This policy creates a network watcher resource in regions with virtual networks.
